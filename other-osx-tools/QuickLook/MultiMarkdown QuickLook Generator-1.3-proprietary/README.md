Title:	MultiMarkdown QuickLook Generator  
Author:	Fletcher T. Penney  
Version:	1.3  

This bundle allows you to preview MultiMarkdown (or Markdown) files as HTML using the QuickLook functionality built into OS X.  It works on plain text files, and on MultiMarkdown OPML files.  It's the successor to the open source QL Generator I released several years ago.  Basically, this version is faster and more reliable, but it is not open source since it uses a few pieces of the code written for MultiMarkdown Composer.

You can modify the CSS used by opening the bundle and looking for `multimarkdown.css`.  Simply add whatever CSS you like!

The bundle is built using MultiMarkdown 4, which is licensed under the MIT License.
