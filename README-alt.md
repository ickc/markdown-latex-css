# My MultiMarkDown Setup

This includes my own setup of using MultiMarkDown on Mac:

- /css/ are extracted from [Marked2](http://marked2app.com). The license of each individual CSS are in the files itself.
- /CSS-preview/ contains previews of some of the css
- /js/ contains abc music notation js
- /QuickLook/ includes 3 different Mac QuickLook generators recommended by [fletcherpenney.net](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/download/).
  - in my own comparison, it seems the official one (MMD-QuickLook 5.0.1) is the best, albeit the author himself recommended the proprietary version (which doesn't have ToC support yet).
- /Spotlight/ contains the mdimporter such that any `.md` files will be indexed by Spotlight. [^ Probably I got it from [here](http://brettterpstra.com/2011/10/18/fixing-spotlight-indexing-of-markdown-content/)]
- /Styles/ contains variants of ByWords styles for MultiMarkDown Composer 2. See the license in the file.
